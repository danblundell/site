## Time off

I took some much needed time out this week. 

As it's the first week of the financial year, it's weirdly a really good time to have off. People were using up leave from last year and there's still a lot of finance stuff going on, working out budgets what's spent, what's not, what's available this year and more specifically for our team...just how much are we going to have to bring in this year to make good.

We actually went away with some friends of ours to Centre Parcs in Woburn - becuase y'know, that's what parents with young kids do these days apparently.

It's unusual for us to go away anywhere with other people but all in all we had a really good week, exploring the woods with the kids, archery, parks, swimming and many many walks. I highly recommend Woburn too, admittedly for us it's a pretty easy drive but it's in a great location, easy to get to and the facilities are absolutely everything you'd need, especially with little ones running about.

I did check Slack and email when I got back on the Friday to check in on things before heading back in the following week. I'm glad I did as it meant I found out that everything I'd put in place before I took time off had gone to plan and we now had a contract with [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) for the whole team - more on that in coming weeks I'm sure.
