## Something I'm learning
* On a practical note, I'm learning to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) properly. As much as I've tried to avoid it, Docker and more specifically, containerisation keeps coming up time and time again. I've only avoided it as there's been no practical use-case for using Docker day-to-day. That said, recently we've found one of the issues that comes up all to often is "how might we reduce the time it takes for a developer to go from nothing to making a change on a real project". One of the messier parts of this is dependencies, for example, things like making sure the right version of software is installed on a machine before you can start work.
