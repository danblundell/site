I don't have time to write proper instructions now so here's enough to remember.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo.
1. Run `docker-compose up`
1. Visit `http://localhost:1313`

## Shutting down
1. To stop, run `docker-compose down`

That should be it?

## Notes to myself
Executing builds and stuff is `docker exec {container_name} {command}`
Deployment is `./deploy.sh` - probably need to check over how this is working again
